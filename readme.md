# SimpleAurelia

A realistic CFD model of the jellyfish *Aurelia aurita* developed for **ANSYS Fluent**. Bell kinematics and swimming speeds are prescribed via the included User Defined Functions (UDF) that control the dynamic mesh motion of the jellyfish body. All UDF are written in C and have been developed for parallel computing environments. The model has been successfully tested on systems of up to 64 cores on Fluent 16.0. \
\
Detailed explanation of the model and its simulations results will appear in forthcoming publications, which will be linked here when available.\
